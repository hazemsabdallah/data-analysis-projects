# Twitter_WeRateDogs--Python-Data_Wrangling

The objective of this repository is to utilize Python and Jupyter notebooks in a data wrangling project performed as part of Udacityâ€™s Data Analysis Nanodegree program. The main focus here is to apply the different parts of the data wrangling process including gathering, assessing, and cleaning. The datasets utilized are partially provided through Udacity in addition to other data that are collected through scrapping Twitter's API.
